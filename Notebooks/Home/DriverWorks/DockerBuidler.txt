DockerBuilder (dkb) have two major commands:

1. lunch [combo_name]
  Simply select from the menu and build one of the pre-defined combinations.
	$ lunch                                     # select from memu, interactively
	$ get_available_lunch_combos                # show the menu
	$ lunch drive-linux-release-nonexperimental # select by combo name, non-interactively

  Naming of lunch combo:
	Hardware  -    OS     - CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (opt level) - build experimental components?
  [host|drive]-[linux|qnx]-[release|debug|relwithdebinfo]-[experimental|nonexperimental]


2. dkb your_cmd_line
  Run your any cmd line inside a docker container selected by your previous 'lunch' command
  You can do this by simply appending 'dkb' before your original command line. E.g.,
	$ dkb echo "hello"
	$ dkb cmake -DYOUR_CMAKE_OPTIONS ..
	$ dkb make -j12 install
  With 'dkb' you can customize your own build steps.

- Bonus:
	$ lunch_go                                  # one-liner before going out for lunch
	$ dkb bash                                  # connect you to the docker behind scene
