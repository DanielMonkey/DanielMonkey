Drivers Included in Linux Kernel
Key Features
Out-of-the-box usage, suitable for most cases
Part of the Linux mainline kernel, classic CAN since 3.2 (peak_pci), CAN FD since 4.0 (peak_usb)
CAN channels are handled as network devices (netdev)

Check: Are CAN drivers part of your Linux environment?
Open a terminal and type:
grep PEAK_ /boot/config-`uname -r`
All PEAK drivers are listed (y=included in kernel, m = separate module) but this may not work in every Linux environment.

Check: Is the CAN device initialized?
Open a terminal and type:
lsmod | grep ^peak
If, for example, a USB-based CAn interface from PEAK is connected and initialized, the output will be at least one line starting with peak_usb.

/usr/local/bin/pcanview
pcanview-ncurs

sudo modprobe peak_usb

# lsusb
...

# ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 250000
$ candump can0 > cantrace.txt
$ candump -tA can0 > cantrace.txt      # includes date/time
$ candump ... can0 | tee cantrace.txt  # so as to read what's logged
