====== 01 Synchronized Time-Base Manager ======
Created Friday 08 March 2019

Synchronized Time-Base Manager (StbM) module
The purpose of the Synchronized Time-Base Manager is to provide Syncrhonized Time Bases to its customers, i.e., time bases, which are synchronized with time bases on other nodes of a distributed system.

Use Cases
* Synchronization of RunnableEntities
An arbitrary number of RunnableEntities must be executed synchronously. 
Synchronous means that they shall start with a well-defined and guaranteed relative offset.

Typical examples of this use case are the sensor data read out or synchronous actuator triggering by different RunnableEntities. 

* Provision of absolute time value
The application (and other BSW modules) shall provide a central module that is responsible for the provision of information about the absolute time and passage of time.

Typical examples of this use case are:
1. Sensor data fusion: Data from various sensor systems like radar or stereo multi-purpose cameras can be temporally correlated.
2. Event data recording: In some cases, e.g. crash, it is desirable to store data about the events and the internal state of different ECUs. For a temporal correlation of these events and states a common time base is required.
3. Access to synchronized calendar time for diagnostic events storage.
