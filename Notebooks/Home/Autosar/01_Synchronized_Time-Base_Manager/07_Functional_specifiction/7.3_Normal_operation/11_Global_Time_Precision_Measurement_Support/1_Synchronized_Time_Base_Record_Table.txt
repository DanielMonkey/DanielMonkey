====== 1 Synchronized Time Base Record Table ======
Created Thursday 16 May 2019

[SWS_StbM_00308]
If Global Time Precision Measurement is enabled (refer to [SWS_StbM_00428] and [SWS_StbM_00307]) for the Time Base, the StbM shall establish a table to record values depending on the Synchronized Time Base with the following structure:
Header {
	uint8		SynchronizedTimeDomain;		# 1 byte
	uint32		HWfrequency;					# 4 bytes Hz
	uint32		HWprescaler;						# 4 bytes
	} # 9 bytes
Block 0 {
	StbM_TimeStampType.seconds							GlbSeconds;				# 4 bytes seconds
	StbM_TimeStampType.nanoseconds					GlbNanoSeconds;		# 4 bytes nanoseconds
	StbM_TimeStampType.StbM_TimeBaseStatusType	TimeBaseStatus;			# 1 bytes
	uint32														VirtualLocalTimeLow;	# 4 bytes nanoseconds
	StbM_RateDeviationType								RateDeviation;			# 2 bytes ppm
	StbM_TimeStampType.seconds							LocSeconds;				#  bytes seconds
	StbM_TimeStampType.nanoseconds					LocNanoSeconds;		# 4 bytes nanoseconds
	uint32														PathDelay;				# 4 bytes nanoseconds
	} # 27 bytes
Block 1 { ... }
...
Block (Block-Count -1) { ... }
(RS_TS_00034)

[SWS_StbM_00309]
If Global Time Precision Measurement is enabled (refer to [SWS_StbM_00428] and [SWS_StbM_00307]) for the Time Base, StbMClockfrequency (ECUC_StbM00051:) shall be mapped to the Header Element HWfrequency of the table belonging to the Synchronized Time Base unless the Virtual Local Time for the Time Base is provided by a Timesync module. In this case, HWfrequency shall be set to 1,000,000,000.
(RS_TS_00034)

[SWS_StbM_00310]
If Global Time Precision Measurement is enabled (refer to [SWS_StbM_00428] and [SWS_StbM_00307]) for the Time Base, StbMClockprescaler (ECUC_StbM_00052:) shall be mapped to the Header Element HWprescaler of the table belonging to the Synchronized Time Base unless the Virtual Local Time for the Time Base is provided by a Timesync module. In this case, HWprescaler shall be set to 1.
(RS_TS_00034)

[SWS_StbM_00382]
If Global Time Precision Measurement is enabled (refer to [SWS_StbM_00428] and [SWS_StbM_00307]) for the Time Base, the Synchronized Time Base Record Table shall contain as many blocks as configured by StbMSyncTimeRecordTableBlockCount [[(ECUC_StbM_00058:).]]
