====== 2 Time Slave ======
Created Monday 29 April 2019

[SWS_StbM_00179]
For Time Bases 0 to 15 each invocation of StbM_BusSetGlobalTime() shall update the corresponding Main Time Tuple and set the User Data and the Time Base Status accordingly.
(RS_TS_00007, RS_TS_00009)

Note: To update the Main Time Tuple does not mean to automatically overwrite the Main Time Tuple with the Received Time Tuple.

[SWS_StbM_00438]
The StbM shall determine for Time Bases 0 to 15 on each invocation of StbM_BusSetGlobalTime() the Synclocal Time Tuple [TLSync; TVSync] by using the value of the Virtual Local Time of the Received Time Tuple as reference (i.e., TVRx is used for TV when calculating TL in [SWS_StbM_00355]). The Synclocal Time Tuple shall be determined using the Main Time Tuple before the Main Time Tuple itself is updated.
