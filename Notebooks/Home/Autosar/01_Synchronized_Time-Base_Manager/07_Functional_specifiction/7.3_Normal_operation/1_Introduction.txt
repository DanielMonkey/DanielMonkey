====== 1 Introduction ======
Created Monday 25 March 2019

A Global Time network contains of a Time Master and at least one Time Slave.
The Time Master is distributing via Time Synchronization messages the Global Time Base to the connected Time Slaves for each Time Domain.
For CAN and Ethernet, the Time Slave corrects the received Global Time Base by considering the Time Stamp at the transmitter side and the own generated receiver Time Stamp. 
For FlexRay, the Time Synchronization mechanism is based on the local time of the FlexRay Bus.

The local instance of the Time Base (derived from a HW reference clock) will be updated with the latest received valid value of the Global Time Base and runs autonomously until the next value of the Global Time Base is received.
