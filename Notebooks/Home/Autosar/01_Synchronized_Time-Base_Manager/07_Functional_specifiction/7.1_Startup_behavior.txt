====== 7.1 Startup behavior ======
Created Monday 25 March 2019

This chapter describes the actions, which shall be performed during StbM_Init().
StbM_Init() shall establish the initial state of the module to prepare the module for the actual functionality of providing Global Time Bases to the customers.

[SWS_StbM_00171]⌈
For each Time Base configured to be stored non-volatile (StbMStoreTimebaseNonVolatile == STORAGE_AT_SHUTDOWN], the Time Base value shall be loaded from NvM. In case ther restore is not successful, the Time Base shall start with zero.
⌋(RS_TS_00004)
Note: The futher details on the NvM handling is intentionally left open. The implementer could choose e.g. between the ReadAll/WriteAll functionality from NvM; or explicit NvM-Block configuration and synchronization; also block restore via callback or via constant.
