====== 7.4 Error Handling ======
Created Friday 17 May 2019

[SWS_StbM_00031]
If a triggered customer is configured (refer to ECUC_StbM_00004: StbMTriggeredCustomer), the Synchronized Time-Base Manager shall monitor the cyclic execution of the StbM_MainFunction(). This is to guarantee cyclic synchronization of OS schedule tables.
(RS_TS_00025)

[SWS_StbM_00199]
For any StbM API service other than StbM_Init() and StbM_GetVersion() all out parameters shall remain untouched, if an error occurs during execution of that API service.
