Created Tuesday 12 March 2019

{{./pasted_image.png?width=600}}
a) Active Customer
This kind of customer autonomously calls the Synchronized Time-Base Manager either
* To read time information (arrow "2" in Figure 1) from the Synchronized Time-Bas Manager or
* To update (arrow "3" in Figure 1) the Time Base maintained by the Synchronized Time-Base Manager according to application information.

b) Triggered Customer
This kind of customer is triggered by the Synchronized Time-Base Manager (arrow "1" in Figure 1). 
Thus, the Synchronized Time-Base Manager itself is aware of the required functionality of the customer, and uses the defined interface of the customer to access it.
This functionality is currently limited to synchronization of OS Schedule Tables.

c) Notification Customer
This kind of customer is notified by the Synchronized Time-Base Manager (arrow "4" in Figure 1), if the following Time Base related events occur:
* Time Base status has changed (e.g. a timeout has occurred for a Time Base)
* Time Base value has reached a give value, which has been previously set by the customer (arrow "5" in Figure 1).
