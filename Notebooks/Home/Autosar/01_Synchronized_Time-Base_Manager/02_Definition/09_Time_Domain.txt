====== 09 Time Domain ======
Created Tuesday 12 March 2019

Definition:
A Time Domain denotes which components (e.g. nodes, communication systems) are linked to a certain Time Base. 
A Time Domain can contain no or more than one Time Sub-domains.
If the timing hierarchy of a Time Domain contains no Time Gateways, i.e. all nodes are connected to the same bus system, then there is no dedicated Time Sub-domain which otherwise would be equal to the Time Domain itself.
