Created Wednesday 20 March 2019

Definition:
A Time Gateway is a set of entities where one entity is acting as Time Slave for a certain Time Base.
The other (one or more) entities are acting as Time Masters which are distributing this Time Base to sets of Time Slaves.

A Time Gateway can be connected to different types of bus systems (e.g. the slave side could be connected to a FlexRay bus whereas the master side could be connected to a CAN bus system).
