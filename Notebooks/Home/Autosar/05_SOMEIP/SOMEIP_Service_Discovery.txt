====== SOMEIP Service Discovery ======
Created Monday 04 March 2019

The SOME/IP Service Discovery is used to locate service instances and to detect if service instances are running as well as implementing the Publish/Subscribe handling.
This is mainly done via so-called offer messages; that means that each device broadcasts (multicasts) messages which contain all the services which are offered by this device. 
SOME/IP SD messages are sent via UDP.
If services are required by client applications but at the moment not offered, then also "find messages" can be sent.
Other SOME/IP SD messages can be used for publishing or subscribing an eventgroup.

The following picture shows the general structure of a SOME/IP SD message.
