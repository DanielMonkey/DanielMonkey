Scalable service-Oriented MiddlewarE over IP (SOME/IP)

Overview
SOME/IP is an automotive middleware solution that can be used for control messages. It was designed from beginning on to fit devices sizes and different operating systems perfectly. This includes small devices like cameras, AUTOSAR devices, and up to head units or telematics devices. It was also made sure that SOME/IP supports features of the infotainment domain as well as that of other domains in the vehicle, allowing SOME/IP to be used for MOST replacement scenarios as well as more traditional CAN scenarios.

While IT solution often only support single middleware features (e.g. RPC or Public/Subscribe), SOME/IP supports a wide range of middleware features:
* Serialization - transforming into and from on-wire representation.
* Remote Procedure Call (RPC) - implementing remote invocation of functions.
* Service Discovery (SD) - dynamically configuring which data is needed and shall be sent to the client.
* Segmentation of UDP messages - allowing the transport of large SOME/IP messages over UDP without the need of fragementation.
