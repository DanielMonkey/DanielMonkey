====== 22 Rate Adaption ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

Definition:
Rate Adaption corrects time offsets gradually within a predefined timespan.
Hereto, Rate Adaption switches the rate of the local instance of the Time Base temporarily to a different value. This rate is chosen to completely eliminate the offset within the preconfigured timespan.
Like Rate Correction, Rate Adaption does not adjust the local instance of the Time Base (including hardware reference clock). It merely corrects the clock values on-the-fly when they are read.

Note: Rate Adaption and Rate Correction use a similar mechanism. They are however completely independent from each other.
