====== 20 Offset Correction ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

Definition:
Offset Correction corrects absolute time deviations (offsets). Depending on the magnitude of the offset and the configuration of StbM, this correction is either performed by Jump Correction or Rate Adaption.
Offset Correction is independent from Rate Correction. It is performed each time the local instance of the Time Base is synchronized to its Global Time Base.
