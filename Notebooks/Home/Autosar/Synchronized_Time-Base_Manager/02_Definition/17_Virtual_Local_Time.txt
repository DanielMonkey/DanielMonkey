====== 17 Virtual Local Time ======
Created Wednesday 20 March 2019

Definition:
The Virtual Local Time is a time which is driven by the OS counter or a hardware clock and which in turn drives a Synchronized Time Base.
The associated Synchronized Time Base has an offset to the Virtual Local Time.
For Time Slaves there is usually also a deviation in rate caused by different clock drifts of the HW reference clocks used by Time Master and Time Slave.

The term Virtual Local Time describes a Time Base whose time progresses monotonously without jumps.

Virtual Local Time Bases are necessary for interpolating
* local instances of Synchronized Time Bases (in either Master or Slave)
* Pure Local Time Bases
* and Offset Time Bases (in case of rate correction)

In addition, Virtual Local Time Bases can be used to measure timespans, i.e., for rate correction measurement intervals or timeouts.

Virtual Local Time Bases are based on a hardware clock and can be derived from various sources:
* OS counter
* GPT counter
* Ethernet freerunning counter (used for ingress and egress timestamping)

It is possible to use different Virtual Local Time Bases in parallel.

Although the different counter sources vary regarding tick duration and counter width, each derived Virtual Local Time Base has the same width (64 bit) and tck duration (1 ns).
To achieve this, it is necessary to count overflows of the counters and to convert counter specific tick durations if required.
