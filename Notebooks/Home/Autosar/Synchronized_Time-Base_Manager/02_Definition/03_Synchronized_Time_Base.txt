====== 03 Synchronized Time Base ======
Created Tuesday 12 March 2019

Definition:
A Synchronized Time Base is a Time Base existing at a processing entity (actor / processor / node of a distributed system) that is synchronized with Time Bases at different processing entities. A Synchronized Time Base can be achieved by time protocols or time agreement protocols that derive the Synchronized Time Base in a defined way from one or more physical Time Bases. Examples are the network time protocol (NTP) and FlexRay time agreement protocol.

The synchronization will apply to the clock rate and optionally apply also to the clock absolute value.

A Synchronized Time Base allows synchronized action of the processing units. Synchronized Time Bases are ofthen called "Global Time".

More than one Synchronized Time Base can exist at one processing unit, e.g. a FlexRay node will have the Synchronized Time Base retrieved from the FlexRay time agreement protocol in the network cluster but might also have a Synchronized Time Base derived from the time provided by a UTC time server (which is based on a set of atomic clocks). Both Synchronized Time Bases will probably have slightly different rate, and there is no relationship defined between their absolute values.
