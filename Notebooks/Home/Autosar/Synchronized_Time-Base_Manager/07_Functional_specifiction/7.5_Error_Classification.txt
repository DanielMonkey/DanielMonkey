Note:
There exist errors, which are of interest for the user of the Synchronized Time-Base Manager, but the source of failure is somewhere else (e.g., the FlexRay Time Base is not synchronized). Thus, they do not appear in he above-mentioned error list and the Synchronized Time-Base Manager does not perform an error handling for those kinds of errors.
