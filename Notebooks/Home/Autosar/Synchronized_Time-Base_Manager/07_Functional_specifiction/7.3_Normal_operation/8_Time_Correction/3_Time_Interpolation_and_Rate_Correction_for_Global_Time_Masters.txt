====== 3 Time Interpolation and Rate Correction for Global Time Masters ======
Created Tuesday 14 May 2019

Rate correction in Global Time Masters can be applied to Synchronized and Offset Time Bases (including Pure Local Time Bases).

Use cases are setting the rate of a Pure Local Time Base to the rate of a received Synchronized Time Base or adjusting the rate of Synchronized Time Bases to external time sources (e.g., GPS).

Rate correction is applied by setting a correction factor which the StbM uses to correct the Time Base's time whenever it is read (e.g., in the scope of StbM_GetCurrentTime() or StbM_BusGetCurrentTime()).

The interpolation of the Time Base is based on the Main Time Tuple, the current value of the Virtual Local Time and the current Rate Correction value.

[SWS_StbM_00395]
If StbMAllowMasterRateCorrection equals TRUE, an invocation of StbM_SetRateCorrection() shall set the correction value. Otherwise StbM_SetRateCorrection() shall do nothing and return E_NOT_OK.
(RS_TS_00018)

[SWS_StbM_00411]
The StbM shall apply rate correction to a Time Base, if StbMAllowMasterRateCorrection (ECUC_StbM_00043:) equals TRUE and a valid rate correction value has been set by StbM_SetRateCorrection(). 
(RS_TS_00018)

[SWS_StbM_00396]
If the absolute value of the rate correction parameter rateDeviation, which is passed to Stb_SetRateCorrection(), is greater than StbMMasterRateDeviationMax, StbM_SetRateCorrection() shall set the actually rate correction value to either (StbMMasterRateDeviationMax) or (-StbMMasterRateDeviationMax) (depending on sign of rateDeviation).
(RS_TS_00018)

Note:
The actual applied resulting rate will be 
* for Synchronized Time Bases: rateDeviation + 1 (=rrc as given in [SWS_StbM_00424])
* for Offset Time Bases: rateDeviation = (rorc - 1 as given in [SWS_StbM_00424])
with rateDeviation: deviation value passed to StbM_SetRateCorrection()

If aligning the rate of one Time Base to the rate of another one, it is possible to use StbM_GetRateDeviation() and pass the value as argument to StbM_SetRateCorrection().

[SWS_StbM_00424]
The StbM shall calculate the (rate corrected) time (TL) of its local instances of the Time Base as:
TL = TGSync + (TV - TVSync) * r
With
* TV = Current value of the Virtual Local Time
* TVSync = Virtual Local Time part of the Main Time Tuple
* TGSync = Global Time part of the Main Time Tuple
* r = Rate for correcting the Time Base with
   r = rrc for Synchronized Time Bases
   r = rorc - 1 for Offset Time Bases
If StbMAllowMasterRateCorrection (ECUC_StbM_00043:) equals FALSE r shall be set to
* 1 for Synchronized Time Bases
* 0 for Offset Time Bases
(i.e., no rate correction is applied).
(RS_TS_00018)

Note:
TL and TV form a new temporary Time Tuple.

[SWS_StbM_00442]
For Synchronized Time Bases the Main Time Tuple shall be updated according to [SWS_StbM_00441] and [SWS_StbM_00342].

In case of StbM_SetRateCorrection() the StbM shall calculate a temporary Time Tuple according to [SWS_StbM_00424] and replace the Main Time Tuple by this temporary Time Tuple.
(RS_TS_00018)

[SWS_StbM_00443]
For Offset Time Bases the Main Time Tuple shall be updated according to [SWS_StbM_00441], [SWS_StbM_00190] and [SWS_StbM_00304].

In case of StbM_SetRateCorrection() the StbM shall calculate a temporary Time Tuple according to [SWS_StbM_00424] and replace the Main Time Tuple by this temporary Time Tuple.
(RS_TS_00018)

[SWS_StbM_00422]
* For Time Bases with StbMSynchronizedTimeBaseIdentifier 32 to 127 (ECUC_StbM_00021:) and 
* for Time Bases with StbMSynchronizedTimeBaseIdentifier 0 to 31 and StbMIsSystemWideGlobalTimeMaster equals TRUE (ECUC_StbM_00036:)
the StbM shall return on invocation of StbM_GetRateDeviation() the rate deviation that has been set by StbM_SetRateCorrection() for that Time Base.

If no rate deviation has been set, StbM_GetRateDeviation() shall return E_NOT_OK.
(RS_TS_00018)

[SWS_StbM_00431]
For the Time Master of a Synchronized Time Base the StbM shall use rrc = 1, if a valid correction rate (rrc) has not yet been set.
For the Time Master of an Offset Time Base the StbM shall use rorc = 1, if a valid correction rate (rorc) has not yet been set.
