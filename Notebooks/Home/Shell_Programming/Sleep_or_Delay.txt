Created Wednesday 20 February 2019

How do I pause for 5 seconds or 2 minutes in my bash shell script on a Linux or Unix-like systems?

You need to use the sleep command to add delay for a specified amout of time. 
The syntax is as follows for gnu/bash sleep command:
sleep NUMBER[SUFFIX]
Where SUFFIX may be:
1. s for seconds (the default)
2. m for minutes
3. h for hours
4. d for days
