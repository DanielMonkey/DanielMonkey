====== 03 The while statement ======
Created Tuesday 25 June 2019

Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and people do poorly.

We have seen two programs, coutdown and print_n, that use recursion to perform repetition, which is alse called iteration.

Because iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it easier.
One is the for statement
Another is the while statement.

More formally, here is the flow of execution for a while statement:
1. Evaluate the condition, yielding True or False.
2. If the condition is false, exit the while statement and continue execution at the next statement.
3. If the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1.

This type of flow is called a loop because the third step loops back around the top.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates.
Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an infinite loop.
