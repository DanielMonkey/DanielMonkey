====== 04 break ======
Created Tuesday 25 June 2019

Sometimes you don't know it's time to end a loop until you get half way through the body.
In that case you can use the break statement to jump out of the loop.

This way of writing while loops is common because you can check the condition anywhere in the loop (not just at the top) and you can express the stop condition affirmatively ("stop when this happens") rather than negatively ("keep going until that happens").
