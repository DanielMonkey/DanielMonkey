====== 01 Multiple assignment ======
Created Tuesday 25 June 2019

As you may have discovered, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the same variable.
A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value (and stop referring to the old value).

The comma at then end of the first print statement suppresses the newline, which is why both outputs appear on the same line.

With multiple assignment it is especially important to distinguish between an assignment operation and a statement of equality.
Because Python uses the equal sign (=) for assignement, it is tempting to interpret a statement like a = b as a statement of equality. It is not!

Firt, equality is a symmetric relation and assignment is not.
Furthermore, in mathematics, a statement of equality is either true or false, for all time. In Python, an assignment statement can make two variables equal, but they don't have to stay that way.

Although multiple assignment is frequently helpful, you should use it with caution.
If the values of variables change frequently, it can make the code difficult to read and debug.
