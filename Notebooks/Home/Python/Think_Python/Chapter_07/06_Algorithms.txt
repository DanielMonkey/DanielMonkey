====== 06 Algorithms ======
Created Tuesday 09 July 2019

It is not easy to define an algoritm. It might help to start with something that is not an algorithm.

Similary, the techniques you learned for addition with carrying, subtraction with borrowing, and long division are all algorithms. 
One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out. 
They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules.

In my opinion, it is embarrassing that humans spend so much time in school learning to execute algorithms that, quite literally, require no intelligence.

On the other hand, the process of designing algorithms is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.

Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. 
We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain how we do it, at least not in the form of an algorithm.
