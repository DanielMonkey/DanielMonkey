The functions lt and rt make 90-degree turns by default, but you can provide a second argument that specifies the number of degrees. For example, lt(bob, 45) turns bob 45 degrees to the left.
Make a copy of squre and change the name to polygon. Add another parameter named n and modify the body so it draws an n-sided regular polygon.
Hint: The exterior angles of an n-sided regular polygon are 360/n degress.
