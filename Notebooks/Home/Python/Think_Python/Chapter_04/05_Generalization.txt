====== 05 Generalization ======
Created Tuesday 04 June 2019

Adding a parameter to a function is called generalization because it makes the function more general.

If you have more than a few numeric arguments, it is easy to forget what they are, or what order they should be in. 
It is legal, and sometimes helpful, to include the names of the parameters in the argument list.
These are called keyword arguments because they include the parameter names as "key-words" (not to be confused with Python keywords like while and def).

This syntax makes the program more readable. It is also a reminder about how arguments and parameters work: when you call a function, the arguments are assigned to the parameters.
