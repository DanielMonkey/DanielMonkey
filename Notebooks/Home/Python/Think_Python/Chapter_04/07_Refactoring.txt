====== 07 Refactoring ======
Created Wednesday 05 June 2019

This process - rearranging a program to improve function interfaces and facilitate code reuse - is called refactoring.

If we had planned ahead, we might have written polyline first and avoided refactoring, but often you don'e konw enough at the beginning of a project to design all the interfaces.
Once you start coding, you understand the problem better. Sometimes refactoring is a sign that you have learned something.
