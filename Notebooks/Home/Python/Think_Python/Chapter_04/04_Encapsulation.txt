====== 04 Encapsulation ======
Created Tuesday 04 June 2019

Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called encapsulation. 
One of the benefits of encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. 
Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function twice than to copy and paste the body!
