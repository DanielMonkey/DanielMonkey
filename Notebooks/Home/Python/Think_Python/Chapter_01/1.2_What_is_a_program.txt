====== 1.2 What is a program ======
Created Wednesday 20 March 2019

A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
The computation might be something mathematical, such as solving a system of equations or finding the roots of a polynomial, but it can also be symbolic computation, such as searching and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.

The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.
repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
