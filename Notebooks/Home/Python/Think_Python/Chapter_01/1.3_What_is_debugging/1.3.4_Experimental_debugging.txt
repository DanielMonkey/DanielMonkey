====== 1.3.4 Experimental debugging ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing. That is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want. The idea is that you should start with a program that does something and make small modifications, debugging them as you go, so that you always have a working program.
