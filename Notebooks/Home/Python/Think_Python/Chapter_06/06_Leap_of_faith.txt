====== 06 Leap of faith ======
Created Tuesday 18 June 2019

Following the flow of execution is one way to read programs, but it can quickly become labyrinthine.
An alternative is what I call the "leap of faith". 
When you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, you assume that the function works correctly and return the right result.
