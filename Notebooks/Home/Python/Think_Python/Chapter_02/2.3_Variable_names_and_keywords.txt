====== 2.3 Variable names and keywords ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful - they document what the variable is used for.
Variable names can be arbitrarily long. They can contain both letters and numbers, but they have to begin with a letter. It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is a good idea to begin variable names with a lowercase letter (you'll see why later).
The underscore character, _, can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as my_name or airspeed_of_unladen_swallow.

Keywords
The interpreter uses keywords to recognize the structure of the program, and they cannot be used as variable names.
