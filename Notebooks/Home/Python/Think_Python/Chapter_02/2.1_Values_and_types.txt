====== 2.1 Values and types ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter or a number.
These values belong to different types: 2 is an integer, and 'Hello, World!' is a string, so-called because it contains a "string" of letters. You (and the interpreter) can identify strings because they are enclosed in quotations marks.

If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you.
>>>type('Hello, World!')
<type 'str'>
