====== 2.7 Order of operations ======
Created Friday 22 March 2019

When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:
* Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want. You can also use parentheses to make an expression easier to read
* Exponentiation has the next highest precedence
* Multiplication and Division have the same precedence, which is higher than Addition and Subtraction, which also have the same precedence
* Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation).
