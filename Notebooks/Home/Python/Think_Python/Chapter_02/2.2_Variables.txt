====== 2.2 Variables ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A variable is the name that refers to a value.
An assignment statement creates new variables and gives them values.

A common way to represent variables on paper is to write the name with an arrow pointing to the variable's value. This kind of figure is called a state diagram because it shows what state each of the variables is in (thinks of it as the variable's state of mind).
