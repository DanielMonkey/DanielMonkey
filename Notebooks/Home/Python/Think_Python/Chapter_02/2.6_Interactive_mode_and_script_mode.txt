====== 2.6 Interactive mode and script mode ======
Created Friday 22 March 2019

One of the benefits of working with an interpreted language is that you can test bits of code in interactive mode before you put them in a script. 
But there are differences between interactive mode and script mode that can be confusing.

In script mode an expression, all by itself, has no visible effect.
Python actually evaluates the expression, but it doesn't display the value unless you tell it to.

A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.
