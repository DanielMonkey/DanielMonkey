====== 2.4 Operators and operands ======
Created Thursday 21 March 2019

Operators are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. 
The values the operator is applied to are called operands.

The operators +, -, *, / and ** perform addition, substruction, multiplication, division and exponentiation.

In some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator called XOR.

floor division
When both of the operands are integers, the result is also an integer; floor division chops off the fraction part.
In Python 3, the result of this division is a float. The new operator // performs floor division.

If either of the operands is a floating-point number, Python performs floating-point division, and the result is a float.
