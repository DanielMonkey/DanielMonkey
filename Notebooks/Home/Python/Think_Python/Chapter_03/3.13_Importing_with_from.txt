====== 3.13 Importing with from ======
Created Monday 08 April 2019

Python provides two ways to import modules; we have already seen one:
>>> import math

If you import math, you get a module object named math. The module object contains constants like pi and functions like sin and exp.
But if you try to access pi directly, you get an error.

As an alternative, you can import an object from a module like this:
>>> from math import pi

Or you can use the star operator to import everything from the module:
>>> from math import *

The advantage of importing everything from the math module is that your code can be more concise.
The disadvantage is that there might be conflicts between names defined in different modules, or between a name from a module and one of your variables.

Make sure that the code you are looking at is the code you are running.
