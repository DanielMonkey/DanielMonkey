====== 3.2 Type conversion functions ======
Created Monday 25 March 2019

Python provides build-in functions that convert values from one type to another. The int function takes any value and converts it to an integer, if it can, or complains otherwise.
int can convert floating-type values to integers, but it doesn't round off; it chops off the fraction part.

float converts integers and strings to floating-point numbers.

Finally, str converts its argument to a string.
