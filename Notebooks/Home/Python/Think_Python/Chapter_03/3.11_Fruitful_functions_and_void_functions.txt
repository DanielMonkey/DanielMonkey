====== 3.11 Fruitful functions and void functions ======
Created Monday 08 April 2019

Some of the functions we are using, such as the math functions, yield results; for a lock of a better name, I call them fruitful functions. Other functions, like print_twice, perform an action but don't return a value. They are called void function.

When you call a fruitful function, you almost always want to do something with the result.

When you call a function in interactive mode, Python displays the result.
But in a script, if you call a fruitful function all by itself, the return value is lost forever!

Void functions might display something on the screen or have some other effect, but they don't have a return value. If you try to assign the result to a variable, you get a special value called Noe.

The value None is not the same as the string 'None'. It is a special value that has its own type. 'NoneType'
