====== 3.4 Composition ======
Created Monday 25 March 2019

So far, we have looked at the elements of a program - variables, expressions, and statement - in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.

One of the most useful features of programming languages is their ability to take small building blocks and compose them.

Almost anywhere you can put a value, you can put an arbitrary expression, with one exception: the left side of an assignment statement has to be a variable name. Any other expression on the left side is a syntax error.
