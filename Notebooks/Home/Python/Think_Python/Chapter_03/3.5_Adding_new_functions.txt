====== 3.5 Adding new functions ======
Created Monday 25 March 2019

A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the sequence of statements that execute when the function is called.

def is a keyword that indicates that this is a function definition. 

The rules for function names are the same as for variable names: letters, numbers and some punctuation marks are legal, but the first character can't be a number. You can't use a keyword as the name of a function, and you should avoid having a variable and a function with the same name.

The empty parentheses after the name indicate that this function doesn't take any arguments.

The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body.
The header has end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, the indentation is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.

The strings in the print statements are enclosed in double quotes. Single quotes and double quotes do the same thing; most people use single quotes except in cases like this where a single quote (which is also an apostrophe) apears in the string.

If you type a function definition in interactive mode, the interpreter prints ellipses (...) to let you know that the definition isn't complete.
To end the function, you have to enter an empty line (this is not necessary in a script).

The syntax for calling the new function is the same as for build-in functions.
Once you have defined a function, you can use it inside another function.
