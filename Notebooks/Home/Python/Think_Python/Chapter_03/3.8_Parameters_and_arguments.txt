====== 3.8 Parameters and arguments ======
Created Wednesday 27 March 2019

Some of the built-in functions we have seen require arguments.
Some functions take more than one argument.

Inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters.

The same rules of composition that apply to built-in functions also apply to user-defined functions.

The argument is evaluated before the function is called.

You can also use a variable as argument.
The name of the variable we pass as an argument has nothing to do with the name of the parameter. It doen't matter what the value was called back home.
