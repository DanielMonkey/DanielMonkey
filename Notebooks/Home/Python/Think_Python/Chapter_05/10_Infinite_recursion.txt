====== 10 Infinite recursion ======
Created Tuesday 11 June 2019

If a recursion never reaches a base case, it goes on making recursive calls forever, and the program never terminates.
This is known as infinite recursion, and it is generally not a good idea.

In most programming environments, a program with infinite recursion does not really run forever. 
Python reports an error message when the maximum recursion depth is reached.
When the error occurs, there are 1000 recurse frames on the stack!
