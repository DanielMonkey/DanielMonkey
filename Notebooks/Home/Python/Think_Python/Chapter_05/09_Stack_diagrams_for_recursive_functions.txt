====== 09 Stack diagrams for recursive functions ======
Created Tuesday 11 June 2019

Every time a function gets called, Python creates a new function frame, which contains the function's local variables and parameters.
For a recursive function, there might be more than one frame on the stack at the same time.

The bottom of the stack is called the base case. It does not make a recursive call, so there is no more frames.
