====== 08 Recursion ======
Created Tuesday 11 June 2019

It is legal for one function to call another; it also legal for a function to call itself.
It may not be obvious why that is a good thing, but it turns out to be one of the most magical things a program can do.

A function that calls itself is recursive; the process is called recursion.
