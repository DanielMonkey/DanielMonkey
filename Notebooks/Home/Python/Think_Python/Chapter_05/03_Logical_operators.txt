====== 03 Logical operators ======
Created Monday 10 June 2019

There are three logical operators: and, or, and not.
The semantics (meaning) of these operators is similar to their meaning in English.

The not operator negates a boolean expression.

Strictly speaking, the operands of the logical operators should be boolean expressions, but Python is not very strict. Any nonzero number is interpreted as "true".

This flexibility can be useful, but there are some subtleties to it that might be confusing.
You might want to avoid it (unless you know what you are doing).
