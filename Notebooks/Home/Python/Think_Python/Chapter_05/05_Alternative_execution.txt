====== 05 Alternative execution ======
Created Monday 10 June 2019

A second form of the if statement is alternative execution, in which there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed.

Since the condition must be true or false, exactly one of the alternatives will be executed.
The alternatives are called branches, because they are branches in the flow of execution.
