====== 11 Keyboard input ======
Created Tuesday 11 June 2019

Python 2 provides a built-in function called raw_input that gets input from the keyboard.
In Python 3, it is called input.
When this function is called, the program stops and waits for the user to type something.
When the user presses Retur or Enter, the program resumes and raw_input returns what the user typed as a string.

Before getting input from the user, it is a good idea to print a promt telling the user what to input. 
raw_input can take a prompt as an argument.

The sequence \n at the end of the promt represents a newline, which is a special character that causes a line break.
That's why the user's input appears below the promt.

If you expect the user to type an integer, you can try to convert the return value to int. But if the user types something other than a string of digits, you get an error.
