====== 02 Boolean expressions ======
Created Monday 10 June 2019

A boolean expression is an expression that is either true or false. 

True and False are special values that belong to the type bool; they are not strings.

The == operator is one of the relational operators; the others are:
	x != y		# x is not equal to y
	x > y		# x is greater than y
	x < y		# x is less than y
	x >= y		# x is greater or equal to y
	x <= y		# x is less than or equal to y

Although these operations are probably familiar to you, the Python symbols are different from the mathematical symbols.
A common error is to use a single equal sign (=) instead of a double euqal sign (==).
Remember that = is an assignment operator and == is a relational operator.
There is no such thing as =< or =>.
