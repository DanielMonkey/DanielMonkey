The traceback Python displays when an error occurs contains a lot of information, but it can be overwhelming, especially when there are many frames on the stack.
The most useful parts are usually:
* What kind of error it was, and
* Where it occurred

Syntax errors are usually easy to find, but there are a few gotches. 
Whitespace errors can be trickly because spaces and tabs are invisible and we are used to ignoring them.

In general, error messages indicate where the problem was discovered, but the actual error might be earlier in the code, sometimes on a previous line.

The same is true of runtime errors.

In general, error messages tell you where the problem was discovered, but that is often not where it was caused.
