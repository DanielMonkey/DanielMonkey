====== 07 Nested conditionals ======
Created Tuesday 11 June 2019

One conditional can also be nested within another.

Although the indentation of the statements makes the structure apparent, nested conditionals become difficult to read very quickly.
In general, it is a good idea to avoid them when you can.

Logical operators often provide a way to simplify nested conditional statements.
