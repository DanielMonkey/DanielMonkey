====== 01 A string is a sequence ======
Created Tuesday 09 July 2019

A string is a sequence of characters. You can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator.

The expression in brackets is called an index. The index indicates which characeter in the sequence you want (hence the name).

You can use any expression, incuding variables and operators, as an index, but the value of the index has to be an integer.
