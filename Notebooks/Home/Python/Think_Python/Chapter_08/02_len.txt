====== 02 len ======
Created Tuesday 09 July 2019

len is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string.

Alternatively, you can use negative indices, which count backward from the end of the string. The expression fruit [-1] yields the last letter, fruit[-2] yields the second to last, and so on.
