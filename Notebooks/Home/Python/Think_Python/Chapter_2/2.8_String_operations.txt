====== 2.8 String operations ======
Created Friday 22 March 2019

In general, you can't perform mathematical operations on strings, even if the strings look like numbers.

The + operator works with strings, but it might not do what you expect: it performs concatention, which means joining the strings by linking them end-to-end.

The * operator also works on strings; it performs repetition. If one of the operands is a string, the other has to be an integer.

This use of + and * makes sense by analogy with addition and multiplication.
On the other hand, there is a significant way in which string concatenation and repetition are different from integer addition and multiplication.
