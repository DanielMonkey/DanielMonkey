====== 2.5 Expressions and statements ======
Created Friday 22 March 2019

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operations.
A value all by itself is considered an expression

A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. 

Technically an expression is also a statement, but it is probably simpler to think of them as different things. The important difference is that an expression has a value; a statement does not.
