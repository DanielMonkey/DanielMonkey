====== 1.1 The Python programming language ======
Created Wednesday 20 March 2019

high-level language
low-level language - machine languages / assembly languages

Loosely speaking, computers can only run programs written in low-level languages. So programs written in a high-level language have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages.

The advantages are enormous.
First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language.
Second, high-level languages are portable.

Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: interpreters and compilers.

An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.
Figure 1.1 shows the structure of an interpreter.
