====== Range or distance measurement ======
Created Wednesday 13 February 2019

The actual range of a target from the radar is known as slant range.
Slant range is the line of sight distance between the radar and the object illuminated. 
While ground range is the horizontal distance between the emitter and its target and its calculation requires knowledge of the target's elevation.
Since the waves travels to a target and back, the round trip time is dividing by two in order to obtain the time the wave took to reach the target.
