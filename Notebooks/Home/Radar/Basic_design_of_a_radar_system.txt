====== Basic design of a radar system ======
Created Wednesday 13 February 2019

* Transmitter
The radar transmitter produces the short duration high-power rf pulses of energy that are into space by the antenna.

* Duplexer
The duplexer alternately switches the antenna between the transmitter and receiver so that only one antenna need to be used. This switching is necessary because the high-power pulses of the transmitter would destroy the receiver if energy were allowed to enter the receiver.

* Receiver
The receivers amplify and demodulate the received RF-signals. The receiver provides video signals on the output.

* Radar Antenna
The Antenna transfers the transmitter energy to signals in space with the required distribution and efficiency. This process is applied in an identical way on reception.

* Indicator
The indicator should present to the observer a continuous, easily understandable, graphic picture of the relative position of radar targets.
