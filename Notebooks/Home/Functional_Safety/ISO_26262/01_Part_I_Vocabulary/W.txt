walk-through
systematic examination of work products in order to detect anomalies
NOTE 1 Walk-through is a means of verification.
NOTE 2 Walk-through is differs from testing in that it does not normally involve the operation of the associated item or element.
NOTE 3 Any anomalies that are detected are usually addressed by rework, followed by a walk-through of the reworked work products.
EXAMPLE During a walk-through, the developer explains the work product step-by-step to one or more assessors. The objective is to create a common understanding of the work product and to identify any anomalies within the work product. Both inspections and walk-throughs are types of peer review, where a walk-through is a less stringent form of peer review than an inspection.
