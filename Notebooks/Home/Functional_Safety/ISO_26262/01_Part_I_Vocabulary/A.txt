NOTE Intent is not to divide an atomic requirement into multiple requirements. Tracing of an atomic system level requirement to multiple lower level atomic requirements is allowed.

anomaly

NOTE Anomalies can be discovered, among other times, during the review, testing, analysis, compilation, or use of components or applicable documentation.

architecture
representation of the structure of the item or functions or systems or elements that allows identification of building blocks, their boundaries and interfaces, and includes the allocation of functions to hardware and software elements

Automotive Safety Integrity Level
ASIL
one of four levels to specify the item's or element's necessary requirements of ISO 26262 and safety measures to apply for avoiding an unreasonable residual risk, with D representing the most stringent and A the least stringent level

ASIL decomposition
apportioning of safety requirements redundantly to sufficiently independent elements, with the objective of reducing the ASIL of the redundant safety requirements that are allocated to the corresponding elements

availability
capability of a product to be in a state to execute the function required under given conditions, at a certain time or in a given period, supporting the required external resources are available.
