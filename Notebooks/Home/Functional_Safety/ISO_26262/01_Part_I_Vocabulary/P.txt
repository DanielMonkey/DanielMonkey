partitioning
separation of functions or elements to achieve a design
NOTE Partitioning can be used for fault containment to avoid cascading failures. To achieve freedom from interference between partitioned design elements, additional non-functional requirements can be introduced.

passenger car
vehicle designed and constructed primarily for the carriage of persons and their luggage, their goods, or both, having not more than a seating capacity of eight, in addtion to the driver, and without space for standing passengers

perceived fault
fault whose presence is deduced by the driver with a prescribed time interval
EXAMPLE The fault can be directly perceived through obvious limitation of system behaviour or performance.

permanent fault
fault that occurs and stays until removed or repaired
NOTE Direct current (d.c.) faults, e.g. stuck-at and bridging faults, are permanent faults. Systematic faults manifest themselves mainly as permanent faults.

phase
stage in the safety lifecycle that is specified in a distinct part of ISO 26262
NOTE The phases in ISO 26262 are specified in distinct parts, i.e. ISO 26262-3, ISO 26262-4, ISO 26262-5, ISO 26262-6, and ISO 26262-7 specify, respectively, the phases of:
* concept
* product development at the system level
* product development at the hardware level
* product development at the software level, and
* product and operation

proven in use argument
evidence, based on analysis of field data resulting from use of a candidate, that the probability of any failure of this candidate that could impair a safety goal of an item that uses it meets the requirements for the applicable ASIL.

proven in use credit
substitution of a given set of lifecycle subphases with corresponding work products by a proven in use argument
