electrical and/or electronic system
E/E system
system that consists of electrical and/or electronic elements, including programmable electronic elements
EXAMPLE Power supply; sensor or other input device; communication path; actuator or other output device.

element
system or part of a system including components, hardware, software, hardware parts, and software parts.

embedded software
fully-integrated software to be executed on a processing element
NOTE The processing element is normally a micro-controller, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), but it can also be a more complex component or subsystem

emergency operation
degraded functionality from the state in which a fault occurred until the transition to a safe state is achieved as defined in the warning and degradation concept.

emergency operation interval
specified time-span that emergency operation is needed to support the warning and degradation concept.
NOTE Emergency operation is part of the warning and degradation concept.

error
discrepancy between a computed, observed or measured value or condition, and the true, specified or theoretically correct value or condition
NOTE 1 An error can arise as a result of unforeseen operating conditions or due to a fault within the system, subsystem or component being considered.
NOTE 2 A fault can manifest itself as an error within the considered element and the error can ultimately cause a failure.

exposure
state of being in an operational situation that can be hazardous if coincident with the failure mode under analysis

external measure
measure that is separate and distinct from the item which reduces or mitigates the risks resulting from the item.
