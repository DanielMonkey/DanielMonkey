malfunctioning behaviour
failure or unintended behaviour of an item with respect to its design intent

model-based development
development that uses models to describe the functional behaviour of the elements to be developed
NOTE Depending on the level of abstraction used for such a model, the model can be used for simulation or code generation or both.

modification
authorized alteration of an item
NOTE 1 Modification is used in ISO 26262 with respect to re-use for lifecycle tailoring.
NOTE 2 A change is applied during the lifecycle of an item, while a modification is applied to create a new item from an existing item.

multiple-point failure
failure, resulting from the combination of several independent faults, which leads directly to the violation of a safety goal
NOTE For a multiple-point failure to directly violate a safety goal, the presence of all independent faults is necessary, i.e. the violation of a safety goal due to a combination of a residual fault with other independent faults is not considered a mutliple-point failure.

multiple-point fault
individual fault that, in combination with other independent faults, leads to a multiple-point failure 
NOTE A multiple-point fault can only be recognized after the identification of multiple-point failure, e.g. from cut set analysis of a fault tree.

multiple-point fault detection interval
time span to detect multiple-point fault before it can contribute to a mutliple-point failure
