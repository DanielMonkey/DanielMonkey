dedicated measure
measure to ensure the failure rate claimed in the evaluation of the probability of violation of safety goals.
EXAMPLE Design feature [such as hardware part over-design (e.g. electrical or thermal stress rating) or physical separation (e.g. spacing of contacts on a printed circuit board)]; special sample test of incoming material to reduce the risk of occurrence of failure modes which contribute to the violation of safety goals; burn-in testl dedicated control plan.

degradation
strategy for providing safety by design after the occurrence of failures.
NOTE Degradation can include reduced functionality, reduced performance, or both reduced functionality and performance.

dependent failures
failures whose probability of simultaneous or successive occurrence cannot be expressed as the simple product of the unconditional probabilities of each of them
NOTE 1 Dependent failures A and B can be characterized when
PAB â‰  PA x PB
where
PAB is the probability of the simultaneous occurrence of failure A and failure B;
PA is the probability of the occurrence of failure A;
PB is the probability of the occurrence of failure B;
NOTE 2 Dependent failures include common cause failure and cascading failures.

detected fault
fault whose presence is detected within a prescribed time by a safety mechanism that prevents the fault from being latent
EXAMPLE The fault can be detected by a dedicated safety mechanism (e.g. detection of the error and notifying the driver via an alerting device on the instrument panel) as defined in the functional safety concept.
