random hardware failure
failure that can occur unpredictably during the lifetime of a hardware element and that follows a probability distribution
NOTE Random hardware failure rates can be predicted with reasonable accuracy.

reasonably foreseeable event
event that is technically possible and has a credible or measurable rate of occurrence

redundancy
existence of means in addition to the means that would be sufficient for an element to perform a required function or to represent information
NOTE Redundancy is used in ISO 26262 with respect to achieving a safety goal or a specified safety requirement, or to representing safety-related information
EXAMPLE 1 Duplicated functional components can be an instance of redundancy for the purpose of increasing availability or allowing fault detection
EXAMPLE 2 The addition of parity bits to data representing safety-related information provides redundancy for the purpose of allowing fault detection.

regression strategy
strategy to verify that an implemented change did not affect the unchanged, existing and previously verified parts or properties of an item or an element

residual fault
portion of a fault that by itself leads to the violation of a safety goal, occurring in a hardware element, where that portion of the fault is not covered by safety mechanisms
NOTE This presumes that the hardware element has safety mechanism coverage for only a portion of its faults.
EXAMPLE If low (60%) coverage is claimed for a failure mode, the other 40% of that same failure mode is the residual fault.

residual risk
risk remaining after the development of safety measures

review
examination of a work product, for achievement of the intended work product gaol, according to the purpose of the review
NOTE Reviews can be supported by checklists.

risk
combination of the probability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm

robust design
design that has the ability to function correctly in the presence of invalid inputs or stressful environmental conditions
NOTE Robustness can be understood as follows:
- for software, robustness is the ability to respond to abnormal inputs and conditions
- for hardware, robustness is the ability to be immune to environmental stress and stable over the service life within design limits
- in the context of ISO 26262, robustness is the ability to provide safe behaviour at boundaries.
